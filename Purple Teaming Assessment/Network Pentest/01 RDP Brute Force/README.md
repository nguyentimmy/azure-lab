# RDP Brute Force Lab (In Progress - Rough Draft)

The purpose of this lab is to detect and alert brute forcing activities on my Azure environment. I am using cloud based native security solutions such as Microsoft Sentinel. In this simple demonstration. I will provide POC that includes commands, syntax, and screenshots.

# Phase 1

- **Bullet 1:** As you can see on the result on the nmap scan, RDP is open on this Windows server. If hackers see RDP or SSH open, they will try to exploit these protocol to gain access. Depending on the scenario, it's best not to use these NMAP flags. This scan is very loud and can get detected by most modern security solutions *(EX: IDS, IPS, SIEM, EDR, XDR)*. But for the sake of demonstration purposes, I will run the scans anyway to see what ports are open on the server.
  ```
  nmap -sC -sV -vvv -T5 -oN report.txt 10.0.0.4
  ```

- **Bullet 2:** Once RDP is discovered, I performed a brute force attack on the open RDP using Hydra. This should also generate the traffic and alerts I set up within Sentinel.
   ```
   hydra -t 1 -V -l winserver -P rockyou.txt rdp://10.0.0.4
   ```

# Phase 2

Next, it's time to see if we can detect the traffic and alerts on Microsoft Sentinel. I created an alert that will generate an incident if it detects multiple failed sign-ins based on **Event Code 4625.** The event code documents every failed login attempts on a local machine.

- **Bullet 1:** The alerts and configuration I set up picked up the "possible" brute forcing attack.
- **Bullet 2:** I've set the alert to auto-assign the incident to myself, update the severity to high, and the map entities.
